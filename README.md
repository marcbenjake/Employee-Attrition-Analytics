# **Watson Healthcare Employee Attrition Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns at Watson Healthcare using Tableau to identify key drivers of turnover and provide data-driven recommendations for improving retention.

**Dataset:** 1,676 employees | **Overall Attrition Rate:** 11.87% (199 employees) | **Avg Tenure:** 7.03 years | **Avg Age:** 37 years

---

## **Key Findings**

### **1. Work-Life Balance is the #1 Attrition Driver**
- **Poor WLB:** 27% attrition (2.3x hospital average) - **HIGHEST RISK FACTOR**
- **Better WLB:** 10% attrition
- **Clear inverse relationship:** Improving work-life balance dramatically reduces turnover

### **2. Young Employee Retention Crisis**
- **Under 25:** 41% attrition (3.5x hospital average)
- **25-34:** 17% attrition
- **35-44:** 5% attrition
- **45-54:** 4% attrition
- Hospital is losing nearly half of young workforce before ROI on training

### **3. Compensation Strongly Predicts Retention**
- **Low salary (<$5K/month):** 18% attrition
- **Mid-range ($10K-$15K/month):** 1% attrition - **"Golden Zone"**
- **High salary ($15K-$19K/month):** 7% attrition
- Clear ROI: Competitive pay = retention

### **4. Department Performance Varies Significantly**
| Department | Attrition Rate | Employees |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Cardiology** | 13.94% | 531 |
| **Maternity** | 12.31% | 796 |
| **Neurology** | 7.74% | 349 |

Neurology's best practices should be studied and replicated.

### **5. Training Investment Matters - But Quality is Critical**
- **0 trainings:** 21% attrition (61 employees)
- **1 training:** 6% attrition (**best retention**)
- **2 trainings:** 15% attrition (611 employees - **36% of workforce**) - **quality problem**
- **3+ trainings:** 8-13% attrition

**Insight:** Just 1 training reduces attrition by 72%, but poor-quality 2nd training drives employees away.

### **6. Job Satisfaction Shows Strong Correlation**
- **Low satisfaction:** 16% attrition
- **Very high satisfaction:** 8% attrition
- Employee engagement initiatives are proven retention tools

### **7. Geographic "Frustration Zone"**
- **15-19 km commute:** 22% attrition (**highest**)
- **0-4 km (close):** 9% attrition (**best**)
- **25+ km (far):** 11% attrition (self-selected committed employees)

### **8. Internal Mobility is a Retention Risk**
- **New to role (0 years):** 27-29% attrition regardless of promotion
- **Recently promoted:** 16% attrition (promotions backfiring without support)
- **11-15 years since promotion:** 4% attrition (career contentment)

**Insight:** Role transitions need better onboarding and support.

### **9. The Critical First Decade**
- **0-10 years tenure:** 14% attrition (1,255 employees - **75% of workforce**)
- **11-20 years tenure:** 5% attrition (dramatic drop)
- **21-30 years tenure:** 1% attrition (peak loyalty)

**10-year milestone = retention threshold**

### **10. Additional Notable Patterns**
- **Gender disparity:** Female attrition higher overall; HR-educated females at 38%
- **Job roles:** "Other" (16%), Nurses (13%), Therapists (2%), Admin (0-1%)
- **Education field:** Healthcare-educated more stable than business-educated (transferable skills issue)

- Salary: <$5K/month
- Work-Life Balance: Poor
- Job Satisfaction: Low
- Training: 0-2 sessions
- Distance: 15-19 km
- New to role (0 years)

### **Stable Profile (1-3% estimated attrition):**
- Age: 35-54
- Tenure: 10+ years
- Department: Neurology
- Salary: $10K-$15K/month
- Work-Life Balance: Better
- Job Satisfaction: High/Very High
- Training: 3+ sessions
- Distance: 0-4 km
- Established in role (6+ years)
